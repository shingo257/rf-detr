"""Apple Neural Engine loadability and fallback boundary of fp16 CoreML exports (``e2e_coreml``, opt-in).

Apple's ANE compiler rejects a whole fp16 program ("Invalid layer") when the two-stage ``enc_output_norm`` still
carries its identity affine *and* the encoder token count is a multiple of 32; ``src/rfdetr/models/transformer.py``
documents the mechanism at the code it constrains. Under ``ComputeUnit.ALL`` — the default in both coremltools and
Swift — Core ML then cannot build an execution plan and ``predict`` raises.

The token count is ``(resolution / patch_size) ** 2``, so RFDETRNano's resolution picks the case: 384 px reaches
576 tokens and was rejected before the fix, while 448 px reaches 784 and was always accepted. Keeping both
separates a real regression from a broken host or toolchain.

These tests report on the machine they run on. Where no Neural Engine is available (a virtualized CI runner, for
instance) Core ML never invokes its compiler, so the load test passes regardless and the compute-plan tests skip:
the plan would then describe the host, not the exported graph. The hardware-free guard for the fix itself is
``tests/models/test_transformer.py::test_two_stage_topk_gather_reads_pre_norm_memory``.
